# Getting Started with Create React App

Roll until all dice are the same. Click each die to freeze it at its current value between rolls. Try to get lowest score possible and beat your own record. 

## How its made

### React
This project was made using plain React

### API
In this project we didnt use any API's. 

### LocalStorage
If you play the game and get a final score try and refresh the page. As you can see the prevoius score is still there because the score gets stored in the localstorage.
