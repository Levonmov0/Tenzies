# Getting Started with Create React App

Roll until all dice are the same. Click each die to freeze it at its current value between rolls. Try to get lowest score possible and beat your own record. 

## How its made

### React
This project was made using plain React

### API
In this project we didnt use any API's. 

### LocalStorage
If you play the game and get a final score try and refresh the page. As you can see the prevoius score is still there because the score gets stored in the localstorage. 

## Future updates
There are many things to do for the updates. Things that i want to do for updates are: 
1. change the numbers to points (so that it looks like a real die).
2. Create a rolling animation while the dice is rolling for more realistic effects.
